It still autosaves, and it always saves when you click 'save and exit'. This means that ragequits may now have a more positive result.\n - Major proof-reading pass on the Russian localisation: about five hundred changes in all. Translator's summary:\n 1. Critical mistranslation, actually, I think it is a copy-paste error: it could confuse the players--in the description of the action it was told to use the Follower card, while the source said to use the Funds card.\n2. Mistranslation in flavor text: there were several of them, though they didn't affect the gaming experience critically.\n3. Several spelling errors, some punctuation issues.\n4. Style is good overall, but in some cases the translation was changed to fit the atmosphere.\n\nv2020.10.f.1, 'A Compass Rose' \n \n - Japanese and German translation fully released! Thank you very much for the (nearly a hundred!) detailed and helpful feedback mails we got about the beta translation.",
