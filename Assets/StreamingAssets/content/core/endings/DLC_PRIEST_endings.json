The space where I was will be a postern-gate in the fortress of days, that only my initiates will ever pass. But in the Fifth History alone, my skin will peel from me in tatters. My teeth will be long and my flesh scant upon my bones as sea-wrack, and I will rise like a wave and hood myself to mark what I have become. \n[Congratulations on a Threshold victory. You have wrestled the game to its knees. There are other paths.]",

She is with me now as the Sister with the Witch, and with aching joy I found dissolution. Now my roots go deep into the churchyard earth where they buried the stinking mud they thought was all of me, and past the Earth into what lies beneath. Now all those who linger beneath our branches will see us in their dreams, the Mare and me, and they will follow us into the Wood.  \n[Congratulations on a  Dissolution anti-victory. You have wrestled the game to its knees. There are other paths.]",
